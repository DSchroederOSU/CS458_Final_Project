READING PLATO
Jorie GrahamThis is the story 
     of a beautiful 
lie, what slips 
     through my fingers, 
your fingers. It's winter, 
     it's far 

in the lifespan 
     of man. 
Bareheaded, in a soiled 
     shirt, 
speechless, my friend 
     is making 

lures, his hobby. Flies 
     so small 
he works with tweezers and 
     a magnifying glass. 
They must be 
     so believable 

they're true - feelers, 
     antennae, 
quick and frantic 
     as something 
drowning. His heart 
     beats wildly 

in his hands. It is 
     blinding 
and who will forgive him 
     in his tiny 
garden? He makes them 
     out of hair, 

deer hair, because it's hollow 
     and floats. 
Past death, past sight, 
     this is 
his good idea, what drives 
     the silly days 

together. Better than memory. Better 
     than love. 
Then they are done, a hook 
     under each pair 
of wings, and it's Spring, 
     and the men 

wade out into the riverbed 
     at dawn. Above, 
the stars still connect-up 
     their hungry animals. 
Soon they'll be satisfied 
     and go. Meanwhile 

upriver, downriver, imagine, quick 
     in the air, 
in flesh, in a blue 
     swarm of 
flies, our knowledge of 
     the graceful 

deer skips easily across 
     the surface. 
Dismembered, remembered, 
     it's finally 
alive. Imagine 
     the body 

they were all once 
     a part of, 
these men along the lush 
     green banks 
trying to slip in 
     and pass 

for the natural world.
