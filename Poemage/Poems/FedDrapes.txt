Fed Drapes
Clark Coolidge


FELL FAR BUT THE BARN (came) up & smacked me
Who're you, bleeding? Fled.
Blat in back of a Vistrola Car
is so red is such that sun
fell in the rushes & pen bear appear

the white wrong numeral on the wall
can't take if off with the clock
             down with the clock it â€¦
                way
on the board - couch with brass, kindergarten clench joints
backed violet rip into the gas valve
it hemmed & snowed

      the wrong way
         remnant face
             rubber 
      the pucker
