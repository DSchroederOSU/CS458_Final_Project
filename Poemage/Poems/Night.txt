Night
Louise Bogan

The cold remote islands
And the blue estuaries 
Where what breathes, breathes
The   restless wind of the inlets,
And what drinks, drinks
The incoming tide;

Where shell and weed
Wait upon the salt wash of the sea,
And the clear nights of stars
Swing their lights westward
To set behind the land;

Where the pulse clinging to the rocks
Renews itself forever; 
Where, again on cloudless nights,
The water reflects
The firmament's partial setting;

-O remember o'er
In your narrowing dark hours
That more things move
Than blood in the heart.
