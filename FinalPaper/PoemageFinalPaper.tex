\section{Related Work} \label{research}

Close reading through computational means is a very difficult problem to tackle due to its large problem set and complexity by nature. Most design decisions for computational close reading tend to focus on a specific area of interest within close reading, for example sound or rhyme. Nina McCurdy from The University of Utah wrote: ``Close reading covers a broad range of tasks, encompasses varying styles of analysis, allows many different points of entry, and accepts an extensive range of sometimes radically divergent interpretations'' when describing the complexity of text analysis \cite{poemage}.\\
There have been numerous previous projects trying to tackle close reading via visualization and computation like E-Margin \cite{emargin} and Myopia \cite{myopia}. The Poemage team took a slightly different course during their development by focusing on sounds and creating a program that could ``automatically sonify a poem'' \cite{poemage}. All previous projects address the problem of close reading as an interpretation of text at the level of individual words in order to interpret and examine literary context. A large issue with addressing this problem is that it is usually done in an academic setting where someone is trying to ``teach'' the literature, and hand written evaluations tend to be messy and difficult to understand. These close reading visualization projects attempt to help visualize textual interpretations so that it can be taught and evaluated easily and effectively.\\
We wanted to branch off from the Poemage style of using drawn ellipses to highlight words of interest and search for other methods of text highlighting that may increase the effectiveness of the visualization. We sought to highlight individual syllables or letters that applied to the filtered rhyme scheme or rhyme rule rather than circling the entire word. There has been extensive research on text highlighting techniques conducted by the information visualization community. A paper from IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics states that ``Text highlighting is important in any scenario where close reading (sequential word-by-word reading) is required and text annotations exist, that should be made accessible to the reader'' \cite{texthighlighting}.
